Break your terminal/X session (or preferably someone else's)
in all sorts of interesting ways.

xmouse.c
  Make the X11 cursor dance
evil
  Reduce a terminal to uselessness by showing an unkillable
  bash prompt that won't go away and won't perform any
  useful command.
bounce
  Cause the cursor to jump to random positions on the screen
  every few seconds. Great fun *on someone else's
  terminal*. For added effect, run while using "vi".
