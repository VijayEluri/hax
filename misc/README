I made a repository for all of my miscellaneous scripts and
hacks. Then I categorised it, and some things didn't
fit. So, my misc folder has a misc folder. (yo dawg, we
heard you like miscellanies...)

prettyprinter.lua
  A pretty-printer for lua. The only useful function,
  "show", prints out a representation of its argument. It
  handles all the standard Lua types, and has special
  support for tables: nested tables are indented nicely,
  tables are printed out as a combination of any of the Lua
  syntaxes {1,2,3}, {x = 1, y = 2}, {["x"]=1, ["y"]=2}
  according to various heuristics about which would look
  best, and recursion is handled nicely (i.e. doesn't cause
  infinite output). In most cases, output is valid Lua
  (doesn't work for things like functions).
