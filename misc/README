I made a repository for all of my miscellaneous scripts and
hacks. Then I categorised it, and some things didn't
fit. So, my misc folder has a misc folder. (yo dawg, we
heard you like miscellanies...)

  Yeah...
prettyprinter.lua
  A pretty-printer for lua. The only useful function,
  "show", prints out a representation of its argument. It
  handles all the standard Lua types, and has special
  support for tables: nested tables are indented nicely,
  tables are printed out as a combination of any of the Lua
  syntaxes {1,2,3}, {x = 1, y = 2}, {["x"]=1, ["y"]=2}
  according to various heuristics about which would look
  best, and recursion is handled nicely (i.e. doesn't cause
  infinite output). In most cases, output is valid Lua
  (doesn't work for things like functions).
straightdown.c
  Shut down a Linux machine very, very quickly. May have
  unintended consequences (data loss and the like).
unip
  IPv4 addresses are generally written as 4 bytes, in
  decimal, separated by dots. However, it is also valid to
  write them with two, one or zero dots, with the last group
  representing 16, 24 or 32 bits. For example, 192.168.1.1
  is the same address as 192.168.257, 192.11010305, or just
  3232235777. If you are silly enough to base your security
  on how many dots the domain name of a website has, this
  alternative notation will defeat it (don't laugh. MS did
  this for IE4, see [1]. Then, having fixed it, they did it
  again for IE5 and IE6 [2].) These days, it can still be
  used to get slightly more access than the designers
  intended on some badly-designed web kiosks. This is a
  simple program to convert normal 4-group IPs to dotless
  ones.
