This is just a bunch of random scripts that I've written
over the last while. They may be useful, they may be funny,
they may be buggy, they may make your computer explode.
Caveat downloader.

Directories:

annoyances/
  Break your terminal/X session (or preferably someone
  else's) in all sorts of interesting ways.
twisty_code/
  Various strange, incomprehensible twisty snippets of
  code. Warning: Perl.
websites/
  Scripts to automate or otherwise play with various
  websites
misc/
  I made a repository for all of my miscellaneous scripts
  and hacks. Then I categorised it, and some things didn't
  fit. So, my misc folder has a misc folder. (yo dawg, we
  heard you like miscellanies...)
