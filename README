This is just a bunch of random scripts that I've written
over the last while. They may be useful, they may be funny,
they may be buggy, they may make your computer
explode. Caveat downloader.

Directories:

annoyances/
  Break your terminal/X session (or preferably someone
  else's) in all sorts of interesting ways.
twisty_code/
  Various strange, incomprehensible twisty snippets of
  code. Warning: Perl.
