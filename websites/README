Scripts to automate or otherwise play with various websites

inkyisawesome
  Fresh garbage, from inky's meme.boxofjunk.ws, which could very
  likely pass the Turing test on 4chan. This one spent a long time in
  my .bashrc.
pastebin
  Script to paste contents of a file given as an argument or else
  stdin to pastebin.com. Posts it under your own username, and prints
  an url to stdout, ready for cut-and-paste to IRC.
randtube
  Time-wasting of an epic scale. Picks a random word from the English
  language, searches google for YouTube videos about that word,
  returns a random result. Code is... not pretty. Yay for shell
  scripts. See a slightly different version at
  http://netsoc.tcd.ie/~mu/cgi-bin/randtube.cgi
zp
  Incrementally downloads all of Zero Punctuation (by Yahtzee of the
  Escapist Magazine, http://escapistmagazine.com) to the current
  directory, for watching all at once or viewing them in times of no
  intarwub.
