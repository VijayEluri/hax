Scripts to automate or otherwise play with various websites

inkyisawesome
  Fresh garbage, from inky's meme.boxofjunk.ws, which could very
  likely pass the Turing test on 4chan. This one spent a long time in
  my .bashrc.
mung
  mung <lang>, where lang is a two-letter language code such
  as fr, de, ko, ja, etc. will read some text from standard
  in, and use google translate to translate it from English
  to the specified language and back again, often with
  hilarious results (especially with Korean). Examples:
   mung ja:
    input: Does it work?
    output: How it works?
   mung ko:
    input: Do you speak languages other than Korean?
    output: In addition to Korean, you'll know you?
   mung ko:
    input: That's what she thought he said she did.
    output: She said that she thinks he's
   mung ko:
    input: tickle, tickle, poke, poke
    output: ,,, Poke poke Epilepsy Epilepsy
pastebin
  Script to paste contents of a file given as an argument or else
  stdin to pastebin.com. Posts it under your own username, and prints
  an url to stdout, ready for cut-and-paste to IRC.
randtube
  Time-wasting of an epic scale. Picks a random word from the English
  language, searches google for YouTube videos about that word,
  returns a random result. Code is... not pretty. Yay for shell
  scripts. See a slightly different version at
  http://netsoc.tcd.ie/~mu/cgi-bin/randtube.cgi
zp
  Incrementally downloads all of Zero Punctuation (by Yahtzee of the
  Escapist Magazine, http://escapistmagazine.com) to the current
  directory, for watching all at once or viewing them in times of no
  intarwub.
